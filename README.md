# Why?

Storybook is a great tool, but it is writting in React. Lots of efforts have been spend bending Storybook to work with Svelte, but it is not the same. Sveltebook is a Storybook alternative made with Svelte, for Svelte.

It allows you to document your components, create stories, and test them in isolation - with all the Svelte features you know and love.

# Features

- Create stories for your Svelte components
- Use all the Svelte features in your stories
- Write stories and documentation in Svelte or Markdown with [mdsvex]
- Include your components in Sveltebook like you would in your app
- No need to learn Storybook - use the tools you already know
- Add Storybook to your project with a single command
